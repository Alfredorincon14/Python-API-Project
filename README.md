After the analysis of the data we can observe the following trends


1.  the Sun warms less when moving away from the tropical zones

temperatures are higher at the 0 latitud and gradually decrease towards . In general, the higher the latitude, the colder it is, that is, in high latitudes it is less hot than in mid and low latitudes.


2. The further away from latitude 0 the wind speed enters a slight increase 

 As the air moves to  the latitude 0,  The descending  speed air blows from the northeast to the southwest, back toward the latitud 0
 


3. the further away from latitude 0 the humidity drops 

 As the air moves to  the latitude 0,  The descending  speed air blows from the northeast to the southwest, back toward the latitud 0
